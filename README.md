Byebug is a simple to use, feature rich debugger for Ruby 2. It uses the new
TracePoint API for execution control and the new Debug Inspector API for call
stack navigation, so it doesn't depend on internal core sources. It's developed
as a C extension, so it's fast. And it has a full test suite so it's reliable.

It allows you to see what is going on _inside_ a Ruby program while it executes
and offers many of the traditional debugging features such as:

* Stepping: Running your program one line at a time.
* Breaking: Pausing the program at some event or specified instruction, to
  examine the current state.
* Evaluating: Basic REPL functionality, although [pry] does a better job at
  that.
* Tracking: Keeping track of the different values of your variables or the
  different lines executed by your program.

## Requirements

* Required: MRI 2.0.0 or higher. For debugging ruby 1.9.3 or older, use
  [debugger].
* Recommended:
  * MRI 2.1.8 or higher.
  * MRI 2.2.4 or higher.
  * MRI 2.3.0 or higher.

## Install

```shell
gem install byebug
```

## Usage

Simply drop

    byebug

wherever you want to start debugging and the execution will stop there.
If you were debugging Rails, for example, you would add `byebug` to your code.

```ruby
def index
  byebug
  @articles = Article.find_recent
```

And then start a Rails server.

```shell
bin/rails s
```

Once the execution gets to your `byebug` command you will get a debugging prompt.

## Semantic Versioning

Byebug tries to follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) and tries to
bump major version only when backwards incompatible changes are released.
Backwards compatibility is targeted to [pry-byebug] and any other plugins
relying on `byebug`.

## Getting Started

Read [byebug's markdown
guide](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/blob/master/GUIDE.md) to get
started. Proper documentation will be eventually written.

## Related projects

* [pry-byebug] adds `next`, `step`, `finish`, `continue` and `break` commands
  to `pry` using `byebug`.
* [ruby-debug-passenger] adds a rake task that restarts Passenger with Byebug
  connected.
* [minitest-byebug] starts a byebug session on minitest failures.
* [sublime_debugger] provides a plugin for ruby debugging on Sublime Text.
